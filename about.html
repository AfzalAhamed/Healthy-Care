    <h2>About Health Care</h2>
       <p>This is developed to manage customer's health management within Kurunegala district. In Colombo district we can see like these types of projects but other district we cannot find these types of projects. Therefore, we though to bring this type of system to Kurunegala district people. If this product is successful, we have an idea to launch on another district.</p>
